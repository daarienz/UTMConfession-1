# UTMConfession

UTMConfession is my personal project to develop skill about Laravel. It's basically a web-based application of social media that allows user to upload their status or whatever they felt. It's basically like a Twitter, the difference is that users can upload their words anonymously without having to create an account first. This application using MySQL to store data.
